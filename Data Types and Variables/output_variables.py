x = "Tom is"
y = "only"
z = "99"

a = 100
b = 200
# output multiple variables, separated by a comma. Also use the +
print(x, y, z)
print(x + y + z) # Notice the space

# For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator

print (a+b)
print (a,b) # output multiple numbers

# to combine a string and a number with the + operator, Python will give an error

# print (x+a) # try
